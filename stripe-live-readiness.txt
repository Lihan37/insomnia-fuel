Stripe Live Readiness Checklist

- Frontend uses server-side Checkout only; live vs test is controlled by backend secret key and session creation.
- Update deployment env vars: VITE_API_URL to your prod API host, VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to pk_live..., backend STRIPE_SECRET_KEY to sk_live..., and webhook secret to the live one.
- Ensure backend success/cancel URLs use your real domain (e.g. https://yourdomain.com/checkout/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}).
- Expose GET /api/orders/{sessionId} on your prod API over HTTPS and have it verify sessions with the live secret before marking orders paid.
- Configure a live-mode Stripe webhook endpoint; test secrets won’t receive live events.
- Don’t commit live keys; set them as deployment env vars.
- Run a small live payment end-to-end to confirm redirect and order recording.
